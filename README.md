## Testing
My full testing documentation can be found in the testing folder, which can be found [here](testing).

## Deployment
The project was coded in the GitPod IDE. I had previously installed the GitPod browser extension, which allows you to create a GitPod workspace with the click of a button in GitHub.
I first created a new repository in GitHub and then created the GitPod workspace, where I coded the project. 
I used Git within GitPod for version control, with all commits being pushed to the linked GitHub repository. As I was not working on a live website and I was the sole developer, I used only the master branch.

To publish my website in GitHub, I used GitHub Pages from the settings of my repository. After selecting the master branch as the source, my website project can be found here: <https://harclemadscam.github.io/second-milestone-project/>
